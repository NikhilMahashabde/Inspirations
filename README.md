## Installation

The project is hosted online. You can access it by visiting the [Inspirations Website](https://www.inspirations-travel.com](https://inspirations.onrender.com/). Please allow 45-60 seconds for the server to start up, while waiting - you can read all about the app and tech stack below!

## Usage

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up or log in using your Google or GitHub account. Your email and name are the only data stored, and they will not be shared.

3. **Create a Journey**: Once logged in, use the menu to create a new journey. Enter the basic trip information, and you'll have an itinerary with a start and end point.

5. **Add Travel Leg Nodes**: Add various travel nodes like restaurants, destinations, sightseeing spots, etc. You can manually enter a node by filling out the form details or use the AI suggestion by entering a location and letting the AI add a suggestion directly to the itinerary.

7. **Optional - Add Travel Options between Destinations**: Connect travel leg nodes with travel options. You can only add travel options between two destiantions/nodes - Similair to above, adding a Leg can be done manually or using the AI tool.

8. **Refine and Customize**: Edit, delete, reorder nodes and legs to refine your journey.

## Learnings and Personal Feedback

- This app served as a the first major Typescript project that I have undertaken however it could have been utilised to a greater extent by delcaring more rigid interfaces/types rather than reuse existing types with optional parameters. More planning around types should have been done prior to any code entry.

- Focusing on development/code quality not quantity/features - As the app grew larger I realised the value of many techniques that I initially did not pay enough attention to e.g.

  - Rigorously testing for edge cases and thinking of conditions that would lead to broken components such as
    - Setting limits on inputs
    - Page view sizes
    - Data input types / validation / Error checking
  - Creating better error messages, handling and displaying errors appropriately
  - Creating more Github 'issues', branches and better commit messages.
  - Documenting changes for each feature, API, interfaces etc.

- Folder structure - as i worked on the app over time I was severely hampered by disorganised code and as a result gradually started moving into a more organised structure e.g. Splitting up contexts, router, sites/pages, services. I also learnt about feature driven folder surcture but Due to limited time and difficulty of reengineering i chose to continue with a pages appraoch.
- - Splitting code more things into resueable components
  - Using and Reusing API call services / Mutations rather than redfining the queries at component level.
  - Context and Redux - The app was initially started before I had practical knowledge of Redux - in hindsight, due to the complex nature of states used across various features (some of which are currently not enabled), a redux store with actions/dispatch would have led to more orgainsed / clean code
  - I should have broken down simple components into a second level to create reuseable parts which accept props/styling rather than reuse base components. E.g. Styled components

Test driven approach would have greatly improve by confidence in testing for bugs, edge cases, functionality etc. but I did not posses the knowlege of testing when the app dvelopment was underway.
